### GeoBadges are a geocentric system of microcredentials designed to align with and adapt to 21st century learning standards. Anyone can earn digital badges for the work they do both in and out of the classroomâ€”everything from participating in the humanitarian relief efforts of OpenStreetMap, to building their own sensors. <br/><br/>Created by Mapstory's Jon Marino and convened by the American Geographical Society, GeoBadges offer limitless opportunities for personal, professional, and academic growth. The badges are a source of pride that can be shared with friends, educators, and social media at large. Now more than ever, maps are helping people think like global citizens, and GeoBadges are making geographic education more accessible, involved, and interconnected.
