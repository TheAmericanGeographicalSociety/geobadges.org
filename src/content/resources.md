# FAQs: Issuers
- How do I create a Geobadge?
	- Begin by logging into your organization's Geobadges account. Use the toolbar at the top left of the page to navigate to the “issuers” page and select your organization. Here, you click “Create a badge” and enter the image, description, and criteria necessary to receive your badge. You can also link the badge directly to your organization's webpage. Click “Create Badge” to finish.
- What are Tags?
	 - When creating a badge, you will have the opportunity to add tags. These tags make it easier for earners to filter and search through our archive of badges. You should always tag your badge with a difficulty level: 1=beginner, 2=intermediate, 3=advanced. These tags can be edited or added both before and after the badge is created.
- What is Alignment?
	- Some badges align with educational standards, making it easier for earners to achieve them. If your organization’s badge aligns with an education standard, add the information to this section of the “Create a badge” page. Earners will then be able to see how the badge aligns. 
- How do I award a Geobadge to an earner?
	 - Your organization’s Geobadges are visible on your issuer’s page. Navigate to the badge you would like to award, and click “award badge.” If you would like to award the badge to multiple recipients, select “click here to bulk award” to upload a list of recipients that matches the suggested template offered. To award a single recipient, input their name and a means of contact. Next, you have the option to add a narrative, evidence that they met the criteria, or an expiration to the badge you are awarding. Once finished, click “award badge.” The recipient will receive an email alert notifying them of their new badge! 

# FAQs: Earners
- What are Geobadges?
	 - Created to leverage the power of mapping and inspire student learning, GeoBadges are a geocentric system of microcredentials designed to align with and adapt to 21st century learning standards. Students can earn digital badges for the work they do both in and out of the classroom—everything from participating in the humanitarian relief efforts of OpenStreetMap, to building their own sensors. Created by Storymap’s Jon Marino and convened by the American Geographical Society with technical design from GeoSurge LLC, GeoBadges offer limitless opportunities for personal, social, and academic growth. The badges are a source of pride that can be shared with friends, educators, and social media at large. Now more than ever, maps are helping students think like global citizens, and Geobadges are making geographic education more accessible, involved, and interconnected.
- How do I set up my Geobadges account?
	 - Geobadges are connected to your email address. This means if you have been earning badges through TechChange, YouthMappers, or other organizations, you should create your Geobadges account using the same email address. This will preserve your badges and allow you to access/earn them across platforms. 
- How do I earn a Geobadge?
	 - The criteria to earn each badge is different. Use the search bar to navigate through badge collections, difficulty levels, and issuers. Once you’ve found a badge you’d like to earn, click on it to view its awarding criteria. Once you’ve met the criteria, return to the badge’s page and select “Claim Badge.”
- How do I claim a Geobadge?
	- Each badge has a coordinating criteria page that lists what must be done to achieve it. Once you have met all of the listed criteria, you can return to the badge page, select “claim badge,” and fill out the required information including evidence of your achievement. Some badges need to be claimed directly from the issuer. In these circumstances, the badge will have an email address that you can use to contact the issuer and claim your badge. 
- How do I view my earned Geobadges?
	- Use the toolbar at the top left of the screen to navigate to your Backpack! Here is where all your badges are displayed and organized. You can search through them, sort them by issuer, or change how they are displayed.
- What can I do with my Geobadges?
	- Geobadges should be a source of pride! Using the toolbar at the top left of the page, navigate to your Backpack. This is where your badges are displayed! Select the badge you’d like to show off, and from its landing page select “Share Badge.” Here you can retrieve the link to the badge, post it on social media networks (Facebook, Linked In, Twitter, Pinterest) or receive the HTML code to post elsewhere.
